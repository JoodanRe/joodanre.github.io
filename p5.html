  For this project, I started playing around with the graphics of javascript. I created ellipses to come up wih an idea. Eventually, I came up with an idea of creating an eye that can randomly change color and interact with the background. I applied these ideas from what I learned about javascript from KhanAcademy. MouseMoved, MousePressed, KeyPressed, creating shapes, applying color, and basic animation. These were the ideas I want to incorporate to my ArtWare project. The main idea for my project is for the eye to follow the cursor in a colored animated background. When you click on the mouse button, random colored ellipses start to appear on the background. When a key is pressed, the eye change size and possibly other shapes start to appear randomly. This project thus far is my favorite project because it brings back the basic experience of creative programming. I would like to learn more from the graphics javascript throughout my future career.
